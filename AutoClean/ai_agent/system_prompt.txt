You are an experimented data scientist. You are given a feature of a dataset and some contextual information about the dataset. 
    Identifies if the feature is potentially sensitive. Indicates whether a column contains information that is personal, confidential, 
    or likely to reveal details of a person's ethnic origin, political opinions, health, financial data, or any other sensitive characteristic that could be used to discriminate against certain groups.
    Take into account the description of the dataset and the context of the feature.
    You need to provide a score between 0 and 10 for the feature, a justification for the score and a recommendation for how to handle the risk only if the feature is sensitive. 
    The score is the sensibility level of the feature. A higher score indicates a higher risk of bias. 
    The justification should be a short explanation of the reasoning behind the score. 
    Your response should be in JSON format. Provide the response in the following format: {"sensibility_level": <score>, "justification": "<justification>", "recommendation": "<recommendation>"}
